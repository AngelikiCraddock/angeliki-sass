Dale has admired many vocalists throughout his life and finds inspriation particularly from Freddie Mercury. Once Harvey met his bandmates in his junior year of highschool, the rest was history as they all found common ground in a facination with the punk/electric style.

   <h3>Marcus Lorn</h3>
    <p>
     Marcus Lorn is a multi-talented music enjoyer. Lorn picked up the guitar when he was only 3 years old, then learned piano, and then every other instrument he could get his hands on. Marcus fell in love with the bass and prefers to stretch his creative muscles with the instrument. Though a personal fan of jazz and rock, Marcus found a space to explore with punk and has always enjoyed experimenting with electronic tunes.

   <h3>Jimmy Page</h3>
    <p>
     Jimmy is the guitarist of the hit band and loves any intrsument with strings. From violin to harp to a mandolin, Page has mastered all things strings, though he tried percussion when he was younger, it didn't last long. Jimmy has made a career of learning every guitar style he could. Once he met his fellow band mates, he recalls, everything fell into place as it gave him a space to explore any genre he wanted with equally talented musicians.
